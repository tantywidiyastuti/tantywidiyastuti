🎓 About Me

I'm a Data Science student from Indonesia who is passionate about transforming data into insights and building intelligent systems.
My interests span across machine learning, data engineering, cloud platforms, and analytics — from exploring regression, optimization, and statistical modeling, to designing ETL workflows and working with large datasets.

I love learning through hands-on projects: analyzing real-world datasets, building dashboards, developing ML models, and designing end-to-end data pipelines.
Currently, I’m actively working on projects related to:

📊 Data analysis & visualization
